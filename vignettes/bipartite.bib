Biological communities are organized in complex interaction networks such as food webs, which topology appears to be non-random. Gradients, compartments, nested subsets and even combinations of these structures have been shown in bipartite networks. However, in most studies only one pattern is tested against randomness and mechanistic hypotheses are generally lacking. 2. Here we examined the topology of regional, coexisting plant-herbivore and host-parasitoid food webs to discriminate between the mentioned network patterns. We also evaluated the role of species body size, local abundance, regional frequency and phylogeny as determinants of network topology. 3. We found both food webs to be compartmented, with interaction range boundaries imposed by host phylogeny. Species degree within compartments was mostly related to their regional frequency and local abundance. Only one compartment showed an internal nested structure in the distribution of interactions between species, but species position within this compartment was unrelated to species size or abundance. 4. These results suggest that compartmentalization may be more common than previously considered, and that network structure is a result of multiple, hierarchical, non-exclusive processes.}, journal={Journal of Animal Ecology}, author={Cagnolo, Luciano and Salvo, Adriana and Valladares, Graciela}, year={2010}, month={Dec}, pages={342–351}}

  abstract = {Networks have become a key approach to understanding systems of interacting
	objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological
	organisms and human society. One crucial step when studying the structure
	and dynamics of networks is to identify communities: groups of related
	nodes that correspond to functional subunits such as protein complexes
	or social spheres. Communities in networks often overlap such that
	nodes simultaneously belong to several groups. Meanwhile, many networks
	are known to possess hierarchical organization, where communities
	are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure. However, the
	fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap,
	where each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the
	consequence that a global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships
	between overlapping groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups
	of links rather than nodes and show that this unorthodox approach
	successfully reconciles the antagonistic organizing principles of
	overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to the existing
	literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link communities
	naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical organization.
	We find relevant link communities in many networks, including major
	biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and metabolic
	networks, and show that a large social network contains hierarchically
	organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales
	while maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link
	communities are fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and
	hierarchical organization in networks to be two aspects of the same
	phenomenon.},

	plant-pollinator webs, eight from forests of the southern Andes and
	two from oceanic islands, with different incidences of alien species.
	Highly invaded webs exhibited weaker mutualism than less-invaded

	Furthermore, composition of the generalized core group of species

	with respect to pollination, interactions with pollinators may even
	increase the stability of a plant community. In addition to plant

  abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest

	analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce

  abstract = {Many analyses of ecological networks in recent years have introduced
	new indices to describe network properties. As a consequence, tens
	of indices are available to address similar questions, differing
	in specific detail, sensitivity in detecting the property in question,
	and robustness with respect to network size and sampling intensity.
	Furthermore, some indices merely reflect the number of species participating
	in a network, but not their interrelationship, requiring a null model
	approach. Here we introduce a new, free software calculating a large
	spectrum of network indices, visualizing bipartite networks and generating
	null models. We use this tool to explore the sensitivity of 26 network
	indices to network dimensions, sampling intensity and singleton observations.
	Based on observed data, we investigate the interrelationship of these
	indices, and show that they are highly correlated, and heavily influenced
	by network dimensions and connectance. Finally, we re-evaluate five
	common hypotheses about network properties, comparing 19 pollination
	networks with three differently complex null models: 1. The number
	of links per species (“degree”) follow (truncated) power law distributions.
	2. Generalist pollinators interact with specialist plants, and vice
	versa (dependence asymmetry). 3. Ecological networks are nested.
	4. Pollinators display complementarity, owing to specialization within
	the network. 5. Plant-pollinator networks are more robust to extinction
	than random networks. Our results indicate that while some hypotheses
	hold up against our null models, others are to a large extent understandable
	on the basis of network size, rather than ecological interrelationships.
	In particular, null model pattern of dependence asymmetry and robustness
	to extinction are opposite to what current network paradigms suggest.
	Our analysis, and the tools we provide, enables ecologists to readily
	contrast their findings with null model expectations for many different
	questions, thus separating statistical inevitability from ecological
	process.},

	Our analysis suggests that the disagreements are based on selective

	that obscure important variability in the data. We analyze a broad
	range of 16 high-quality food webs, with 25-172 nodes, from a variety
	of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Food webs generally have much
	higher complexity, measured as connectance (the fraction of all possible
	links that are realized in a network), and much smaller size than
	other networks studied, which have important implications for network
	topology. Our results resolve prior conflicts by demonstrating that
	although some food webs have small-world and scale-free structure,
	most do not if they exceed a relatively low level of connectance.
	Although food-web degree distributions do not display a universal
	functional form, observed distributions are systematically related
	to network connectance and size. Also, although food webs often lack
	small-world structure because of low clustering, we identify a continuum
	of real-world networks including food webs whose ratios of observed
	to random clustering coefficients increase as a power-law function
	of network size over 7 orders of magnitude. Although food webs are
	generally not small-world, scale-free networks, food-web topology
	is consistent with patterns found within those classes of networks.},

	ecosystem functioning. This is essential for us to be able to predict,
	and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental
	perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions
	of exotic species. 2. Ecological networks can be subdivided into
	three broad types: 'traditional' food webs, mutualistic networks
	and host-parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons
	among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed
	to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network
	configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role
	of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid
	networks, and of body size in food webs. 3. Research into ecological
	networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production
	of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved,
	and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed
	and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction
	strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its
	magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. 4. Another
	significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance
	of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur
	between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks
	is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on
	species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals.
	Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological
	questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory
	of ecology. 5. We conclude by suggesting a number of 'dead ends'

  abstract = {Plant-pollinator interaction networks are characterized by several
	features that cannot be obtained from a totally random network (e.g.
	nestedness, power law distribution of degree specialization, temporal
	turnover). One reason is that both plants and pollinators are active
	for only a part of the year, and so a plant species flowering in
	spring cannot interact with a pollinator species that is active only
	in autumn. In this paper we build a stochastic model to simulate
	the plant-pollinator interaction network, taking into account the
	duration of activity of each species. To build the model we used
	an empirical plant-pollinator network from a Mediterranean scrub
	community surveyed over four years. In our simulated annual cycle
	we know which plant and pollinator species are active, and thus available
	to interact. We can obtain simulated plant-pollinator interaction
	networks with properties similar to the real ones in two different
	ways: (i) by assuming that the frequency distribution of both plant
	and pollinator duration of activity follow an exponential function,
	and that interaction among temporally coexisting species are totally
	random, and (ii) by assuming more realistic frequency distributions
	(exponential for pollinators, lognormal for plants) and that the
	interaction among coexisting species is occurring on a per capita
	basis. In the latter case we assume that there is a positive relationship
	between abundance and duration of activity. In our model the starting
	date of the species activity had little influence on the network
	structure. We conclude that the observed plant-pollinator network
	properties can be produced stochastically, and the mechanism shaping
	the network is not necessarily related to size constraints. Under
	such conditions co-evolutionary explanations should be given with

  abstract = {Many ecosystem services are delivered by organisms that depend on
	habitats that are segregated spatially or temporally from the location
	where services are provided. Management of mobile organisms contributing
	to ecosystem services requires consideration not only of the local
	scale where services are delivered, but also the distribution of
	resources at the landscape scale, and the foraging ranges and dispersal
	movements of the mobile agents. We develop a conceptual model for
	exploring how one such mobile-agent-based ecosystem service (MABES),
	pollination, is affected by land-use change, and then generalize
	the model to other MABES. The model includes interactions and feedbacks
	among policies affecting land use, market forces and the biology
	of the organisms involved. Animal-mediated pollination contributes
	to the production of goods of value to humans such as crops; it also
	bolsters reproduction of wild plants on which other services or service-providing
	organisms depend. About one-third of crop production depends on animal
	pollinators, while 60-90\% of plant species require an animal pollinator.
	The sensitivity of mobile organisms to ecological factors that operate
	across spatial scales makes the services provided by a given community
	of mobile agents highly contextual. Services vary, depending on the
	spatial and temporal distribution of resources surrounding the site,
	and on biotic interactions occurring locally, such as competition
	among pollinators for resources, and among plants for pollinators.
	The value of the resulting goods or services may feed back via market-based
	forces to influence land-use policies, which in turn influence land
	management practices that alter local habitat conditions and landscape
	structure. Developing conceptual models for MABES aids in identifying
	knowledge gaps, determining research priorities, and targeting interventions

	parasitoids in an abandoned field in southern England. Root aphids
	were omitted and secondary parasitoids were associated with aphids
	rather than primary parasitoids. All aphids, parasitoids and trophic
	links were expressed in the same units (m-2). Over a 2-year period,
	separate webs were constructed for every month that aphids and parasitoids
	were active in the field. 2. Twenty-six species of plants were attacked
	by 25 species of aphid which were parasitized by 18 species of primary
	parasitoids. The primary parasitoids were attacked by 28 species
	of secondary parasitoids, of which 18 directly attacked the still
	living aphid (hyperparasitoids) and 10 attacked the aphid after mummification
	(mummy parasitoids). The aphids were attended by three species of
	ants. 3. Eleven webs were constructed for the months May to September
	1994 and May to October 1995. Aphids and primary parasitoids were
	most abundant and diverse in June, and secondary parasitoids one
	month later. 4. The ratios of the number of aphid species to the
	number of species of primary parasitoid and hyperparasitoid were
	relatively constant across webs, as was the ratio of the number of
	links involving hyperparasitoids and mummy parasitoids. The ratio
	of the total number of links to the total number of species increased
	with web size. 5. The relative abundance of the species in the different
	webs was well described by a Dirichlet distribution with a common
	parameter. This implies a gamma distribution of aphid abundances
	in the field with few common and many rare species. 6. Predator (i.e.
	parasitoid) overlap graphs were constructed to assess the potential
	for indirect interactions between aphids. Mummy parasitoids were
	the most important group linking different aphids. A quantitative
	overlap diagram was developed to illustrate the potential strengths
	of indirect linkages. Common aphid species shared few strong, indirect
	links via primary parasitoids or hyperparasitoids, but could be strongly
	linked by mummy parasitoids. Symmetrical links were uncommon, and
	rare species were potentially strongly influenced by the presence
	of common aphids with which they shared parasitoids. 7. Ant-attended
	aphids were attacked by fewer species of primary parasitoids and
	hyperparasitoids than those species not attended by ants. Species
	of mummy parasitoids attack, on average, approximately twice the
	number of host species than species of either primary parasitoids
	or hyperparasitoids.},

	at low grazing intensities. In the case of simple plant-herbivore
	interactions, such an effect can result from recycling of a limiting
	nutrient. However, in more complex cases, herbivory can also lead
	to species replacement in plant communities, which in turn alters
	how primary production is affected by herbivory. Here we explore
	this issue using a model of a limiting nutrient cycle in an ecosystem
	with two plant species. We show that two major plant traits determine
	primary production at equilibrium: plant recycling efficiency (i.e.,
	the fraction of the plant nutrient stock that stays within the ecosystem
	until it is returned to the nutrient pool in mineral form) and plant
	ability to deplete the soil mineral nutrient pool through consumption
	of this resource. In cases where sufficient time has occurred, grazing
	optimization requires that herbivory improve nutrient conservation
	in the system sufficiently. This condition sets a minimum threshold
	for herbivore nutrient recycling efficiency, the fraction of nutrient
	consumed by herbivores that is recycled within the ecosystem to the
	mineral nutrient pool. This threshold changes with plant community
	composition and herbivore preference and is, therefore, strongly
	affected by plant species replacement. The quantitative effects of
	these processes on grazing optimization are determined by both the
	recycling efficiencies and depletion abilities of the plant species.
	However, grazing optimization remains qualitatively possible even
	with plant species replacement.},

	with catastrophic declines reported from standard food webs. The
	discrepancy may be a result of the method used: previous studies
	removed species from multiple trophic levels based only on their

	their greater risk of extinction relative to that of plants. In both

	models used to test for statistically nonrandom nestedness are under-

	a class of null models that are ecologically explicit and interpretable.
	Expected values of species richness and incidence, rather than observed
	values, are used to create random presence-absence matrices for hypothesis
	testing. In our examples, based on six datasets, expected values
	were derived either by using an individually based random placement
	model or by fitting empirical models to richness data as a function
	of environmental covariates. We describe an algorithm for constructing
	unbiased null matrices, which permitted valid testing of our null
	models. Our approach avoids the problem of building too much structure
	into the null model, and enabled us to explicitly test whether observed
	communities were more nested than would be expected for a system
	structured solely by species-abundance and species-area or similar
	relationships. We argue that this test or similar tests are better
	determinants of whether a system is truly nested; a nested system
	should contain unique pattern not already predicted by more fundamental
	ecological principles such as species-area relationships. Most species
	assemblages we studied were not nested under these null models. Our
	results suggest that nestedness, beyond that which is explained by
	passive sampling processes, may not be as widespread as currently
	believed. These findings may help to improve the utility of nestedness

  abstract = {Mutualisms provide benefits to interacting species, but they also

	or the frequency of encounters between species increases, the interaction
	will no longer be mutualistic. Thus curves that represent benefits
	and costs as functions of interaction frequency are important tools
	for predicting when a mutualism will tip over into antagonism. Currently,
	most of what we know about benefit and cost curves in pollination
	mutualisms comes from highly specialized pollinating seed–consumer
	mutualisms, such as the yucca moth–yucca interaction. There, benefits
	to female reproduction saturate as the number of visits to a flower
	increases (because the amount of pollen needed to fertilize all the
	flower’s ovules is finite), but costs continue to increase (because
	pollinator offspring consume developing seeds), leading to a peak
	in seed production at an intermediate number of visits. But for most
	plant–pollinator mutualisms, costs to the plant are more subtle than
	consumption of seeds, and how such costs scale with interaction frequency
	remains largely unknown. Here, we present reasonable benefit and
	cost curves that are appropriate for typical pollinator–plant interactions,
	and we show how they can result in a wide diversity of relationships
	between net benefit (benefit minus cost) and interaction frequency.
	We then use maximum-likelihood methods to fit net-benefit curves
	to measures of female reproductive success for three typical pollination
	mutualisms from two continents, and for each system we chose the
	most parsimonious model using information-criterion statistics. We
	discuss the implications of the shape of the net-benefit curve for
	the ecology and evolution of plant–pollinator mutualisms, as well

	network of a scrub community surveyed over four consecutive years.
	Species composition within the annual networks showed high temporal
	variation. Temporal dynamics were also evident in the topology of
	the network, as interactions among plants and pollinators did not
	remain constant through time. This change involved both the number
	and the identity of interacting partners. Strikingly, few species
	and interactions were consistently present in all four annual plant-pollinator
	networks (53% of the plant species, 21% of the pollinator species
	and 4.9% of the interactions). The high turnover in species-to-species
	interactions was mainly the effect of species turnover (c. 70% in
	pairwise comparisons among years), and less the effect of species
	flexibility to interact with new partners (c. 30%). We conclude that
	specialization in plant-pollinator interactions might be highly overestimated
	when measured over short periods of time. This is because many plant
	or pollinator species appear as specialists in 1 year, but tend to
	be generalists or to interact with different partner species when
	observed in other years. The high temporal plasticity in species
	composition and interaction identity coupled with the low variation
	in network structure properties (e.g. degree centralization, connectance,
	nestedness, average distance and network diameter) imply (i) that
	tight and specialized coevolution might not be as important as previously

	We explored the consequences that simple linkage rules based on the

	Independent of the linkage rules used, the inclusion of a small set
	of traits (two to four) sufficed to account for the complex topological
	patterns observed in real-world networks. Optimal performance was
	achieved by a ‘‘mixed model’’ that combined rules that link plants
	and pollinators whose trait ranges overlap (‘‘complementarity models’’)
	and rules that link pollinators to flowers whose traits are below
	a pollinator-specific barrier value (‘‘barrier models’’). Deterrence
	of floral parasites (barrier model) is therefore at least as important

	tious. With an unprecedented global data set, we investi- gated how

	co-occurrence data, typically on islands in an archipelago, can disclose
	the forces at work in structuring a community. Here we present and
	utilise three “scores” S, C and T. S gives the mean number of islands
	shared by a species pair in the presence/absence data under study.
	The scores C and T are based on the way that a pair of species occurs
	on a pair of islands. When each species occurs on a different island,
	this adds to the “checkerboard score” C; if they occupy the same
	island, this increases the “togetherness score” T. In judging whether
	observed values of S, C and T are compatible with a null hypothesis
	assuming no species interaction, we follow Connor and Simberloff
	(1979) in generating a “control group” of (constrained) simulated
	incidence patterns. Presence/absence matrices can have paradoxical
	features, in combining a high mutual exclusion by species (checkerboardedness)
	with a degree of species aggregation that is also high. We show that
	this is in fact inevitable - that, given the usual contraints, C
	and T can differ only by a constant. This means that extreme checkerboardedness
	can be produced by forces making for species aggregation, just as
	well as by those making for avoidance. If we restrict our attention
	to a subset of species, the constraints are less rigid and the S,
	C and T scores are somewhat freer to vary. We consider the confamilial
	subsets in the Vanuatu archipelago as likely candidates for revealing
	any competition forces at work. Calculating the actual S, C and T
	scores for these subsets, we compare them with the corresponding
	scores in a sample of simulated colonization patterns. The actual
	species-distributions differ significantly from what we would expect
	if the colonization choices of different species were uncorrelated
	(save for some biological constraints). The confamilial species of
	the real world share more islands, and occur in a pattern less checkerboarded,
	and more aggregated, than their simulation counterparts. This suggests
	that competition pressures, if they exist, are overcome by countervailing
	factors. The method used is applicable in other ways, and to a wider
	class of problems, in analysing the forces behind community structure.},

	has brought about important insights into the structure of these
	interactions, relatively little is still known about the mechanisms

	overview of the mechanisms influencing the structure of plant-animal
	mutualistic networks. A brief summary is presented of the salient
	network patterns, the potential mechanisms are discussed and the
	studies that have evaluated them are reviewed. This review shows
	that researchers of plant-animal mutualisms have made substantial
	progress in the understanding of the processes behind the patterns
	observed in mutualistic networks. At the same time, we are still
	far from a thorough, integrative mechanistic understanding. We close
	with specific suggestions for directions of future research, which
	include developing methods to evaluate the relative importance of
	mechanisms influencing network patterns and focusing research efforts
	on selected representative study systems throughout the world.},

	hypothesis) under which both specialization and asymmetry of interactions
	would explain species' responses to disturbance. We test these hypotheses
	using data from a plant-pollinator system that has been grazed by
	cattle (i.e., a biological disturbance) in southern Argentina. We
	quantified specialization in species interactions, specialization
	of interaction partners, and species' responses to disturbance. We

	the degree of specialization of a given species and the degree of
	specialization of its interaction partners. However, asymmetry of
	interactions did not explain the variability in species' responses

	oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks,
	spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing
	systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either
	completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological
	and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here
	we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this
	middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing
	amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered,

	like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy
	with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of
	separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans,
	the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration
	graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models
	of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation

A particularly advantageous way to study these systems is through the analysis of the networks that encode the interactions among the system’s constituents. During the last two decades, network science has provided many insights in natural, social, biological and technological systems. However, real systems are more often than not interconnected, with many interdependencies that are not properly captured by single layer networks. To account for this source of complexity, a more general framework, in which different networks evolve or interact with each other, is needed. These are known as multilayer networks. Here we provide an overview of the basic methodology used to describe multilayer systems as well as of some representative dynamical processes that take place on top of them. We round off the review with a summary of several applications in diverse ﬁelds of science.},

The information contained in such interac-tion matrices depends on the sampling design, and typically, compounds preferences (specialization) and abundances (activity). Null models are the primary vehicles to disentangle the effects of specialization from those of sampling and abundance, but they ignore the feedback of network structure on abundances. Hence, network structure, as exemplified here by modu-larity, is difficult to link to specific causes. Indeed, various processes lead to modularity and to specific interaction patterns more generally. Inferring (co)evolutionary dynamics is even more challenging, as competition and trait matching yield identical patterns of interactions. A satisfactory resolution of the underlying factors determining network structure will require substan-tial additional information, not only on independently assessed abundances, but also on traits, and ideally on fitness consequences as measured in exper-imental setups.},

In particular " classical " one-mode (" unipartite ") food webs and bipartite (two-mode) interaction networks are two very active research fields. While often aiming to tackle similar topics (such as community stabil-ity and species coexistence) their data, methods and approaches often differ substantially. In this chapter we shall review the continuum of food web approaches along a set of questions: • Which kind of data form the basis of the network? Are interactions observed or inferred? • What do network nodes and links represent? • What is the focus of scientific questions, which key features and topics are being investigated? • Which methods are employed, and what are their potential pitfalls? We find that the literature on food webs and bipartite networks reveals very different challenges, alt-hough the questions addressed are often very similar. For example, sampling artifacts and ecological interpretation of link strength are issues of vigorous discussion in many studies of bipartite networks, while being accepted largely unquestioned in classical food webs. In contrast, dynamic analyses and their mathematical challenges are behind many food webs papers, while being marginal to bipartite network research. In fact, several substantial criticisms leveled at one type of network are absent from the other for purely historic reasons. We identify challenges common to all network types and suggest avenues for a potentially fruitful transfer of approaches as well as applications between them.},

  abstract  = {The structure of ecological interaction networks is often interpreted as a product of meaningful ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that shape the degree of specialization in community associations. However, here we show that both unweighted network metrics (connectance, nestedness, and degree distribution) and weighted network metrics (interaction evenness, interaction strength asymmetry) are strongly constrained and biased by the number of observations. Rarely observed species are inevitably regarded as "specialists," irrespective of their actual associations, leading to biased estimates of specialization. Consequently, a skewed distribution of species observation records (such as the lognormal), combined with a relatively low sampling density typical for ecological data, already generates a "nested" and poorly "connected" network with "asymmetric interaction strengths" when interactions are neutral. This is confirmed by null model simulations of bipartite networks, assuming that partners associate randomly in the absence of any specialization and any variation in the correspondence of biological traits between associated species (trait matching). Variation in the skewness of the frequency distribution fundamentally changes the outcome of network metrics. Therefore, interpretation of network metrics in terms of fundamental specialization and trait matching requires an appropriate control for such severe constraints imposed by information deficits. When using an alternative approach that controls for these effects, most natural networks of mutualistic or antagonistic systems show a significantly higher degree of reciprocal specialization (exclusiveness) than expected under neutral conditions. A higher exclusiveness is coherent with a tighter coevolution and suggests a lower ecological redundancy than implied by nested networks.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND:Network analyses of plant-animal interactions hold valuable biological information. They are often used to quantify the degree of specialization between partners, but usually based on qualitative indices such as 'connectance' or number of links. These measures ignore interaction frequencies or sampling intensity, and strongly depend on network size.RESULTS:Here we introduce two quantitative indices using interaction frequencies to describe the degree of specialization, based on information theory. The first measure (d') describes the degree of interaction specialization at the species level, while the second measure (H2') characterizes the degree of specialization or partitioning among two parties in the entire network. Both indices are mathematically related and derived from Shannon entropy. The species-level index d' can be used to analyze variation within networks, while H2' as a network-level index is useful for comparisons across different interaction webs. Analyses of two published pollinator networks identified differences and features that have not been detected with previous approaches. For instance, plants and pollinators within a network differed in their average degree of specialization (weighted mean d'), and the correlation between specialization of pollinators and their relative abundance also differed between the webs. Rarefied sampling effort in both networks and null model simulations suggest that H2' is not affected by network size or sampling intensity.CONCLUSION:Quantitative analyses reflect properties of interaction networks more appropriately than previous qualitative attempts, and are robust against variation in sampling intensity, network size and symmetry. These measures will improve our understanding of patterns of specialization within and across networks from a broad spectrum of biological interactions.},

  abstract  = {The topology of ecological interaction webs holds important information for theories of coevolution, biodiversity, and ecosystem stability . However, most previous network analyses solely counted the number of links and ignored variation in link strength. Because of this crude resolution, results vary with scale and sampling intensity, thus hampering a comparison of network patterns at different levels . We applied a recently developed quantitative and scale-independent analysis based on information theory to 51 mutualistic plant-animal networks, with interaction frequency as measure of link strength. Most networks were highly structured, deviating significantly from random associations. The degree of specialization was independent of network size. Pollination webs were significantly more specialized than seed-dispersal webs, and obligate symbiotic ant-plant mutualisms were more specialized than nectar-mediated facultative ones. Across networks, the average specialization of animal and plants was correlated, but is constrained by the ratio of plant to animal species involved. In pollination webs, rarely visited plants were on average more specialized than frequently attended ones, whereas specialization of pollinators was positively correlated with their interaction frequency. We conclude that quantitative specialization in ecological communities mirrors evolutionary trade-offs and constraints of web architecture. This approach can be easily expanded to other types of biological interactions.},

However, it is less clear how habitat modification affects interactions among species. Networks of feeding interactions (food webs) describe the underlying structure of ecological communities, and might be crucially linked to their stability and function. Here, we analyse 48 quantitative food webs for cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their parasitoids across five tropical habitat types. We found marked changes in food-web structure across the modification gradient, despite little variation in species richness. The evenness of interaction frequencies declined with habitat modification, with most energy flowing along one or a few pathways in intensively managed agricultural habitats. In modified habitats there was a higher ratio of parasitoid to host species and increased parasitism rates, with implications for the important ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological control, that are performed by host bees and wasps. The most abundant parasitoid species was more specialized in modified habitats, with reduced attack rates on alternative hosts. Conventional community descriptors failed to discriminate adequately among habitats, indicating that perturbation of the structure and function of ecological communities might be overlooked in studies that do not document and quantify species interactions. Altered interaction structure therefore represents an insidious and functionally important hidden effect of habitat modification by humans.},

In the Lesser Antilles, functionally specialized hummingbird pollination is distinct for plant species pollinated by the largest hummingbird species, whereas the pollination niche gradually integrates with the insect pollinator community as hummingbird body size decreases. The network approach applied in this study can be used to validate functional specialization and community-level interdependence between plants and pollinators, and it is therefore useful for evaluating and predicting plant resilience to pollinator loss, presently a global concern.},

Identifying communities of nodes that tend to interact more with each other than the network as a whole is a key research focus across multiple disciplines, yet many community detection algorithms only use information about the presence or absence of interactions between nodes. Weighted modularity is a potential method for evaluating the quality of community partitions in quantitative networks. In this framework, the optimal community partition of a network can be found by searching for the partition that maximizes modularity. Attempting to find the partition that maximizes modularity is a computationally hard problem requiring the use of algorithms. QuanBiMo is an algorithm that has been proposed to maximize weighted modularity in bipartite networks. This paper introduces two new algorithms, LPAwb+ and DIRTLPAwb+, for maximizing weighted modularity in bipartite networks. LPAwb+ and DIRTLPAwb+ robustly identify partitions with high modularity scores. DIRTLPAwb+ consistently matched or outperformed QuanBiMo, while the speed of LPAwb+ makes it an attractive choice for detecting the modularity of larger networks. Searching for modules using weighted data (rather than binary data) provides a different and potentially insightful method for evaluating network partitions.},

  abstractnote = {The concept of a group is ubiquitous in biology. It underlies classifications in evolution and ecology, including those used to describe phylogenetic levels, the habitat and functional roles of organisms in ecosystems. Surprisingly, this concept is not explicitly included in simple models for the structure of food webs, the ecological networks formed by consumer-resource interactions. We present here the simplest possible model based on groups, and show that it performs substantially better than current models at predicting the structure of large food webs. Our group-based model can be applied to different types of biological and non-biological networks, and for the first time merges in the same framework two important notions in network theory: that of compartments (sets of highly interacting nodes) and that of roles (sets of nodes that have similar interaction patterns). This model provides a basis to examine the significance of groups in biological networks and to develop more accurate models for ecological network structure. It is especially relevant at a time when a new generation of empirical data is providing increasingly large food webs.},

  abstractnote = {Specialization of species in interaction networks influences network stability and ecosystem functioning. Spatial and temporal variation in resource availability may provide insight into how ecological factors, such as resource abundance, and evolutionary factors, such as phylogenetically conserved morphological traits, influence specialization within mutualistic networks. We used independent measures of hummingbird abundance and resources (nectar), information on hummingbird traits and plant–hummingbird interactions to examine how resource availability and species’ morphology influence the specialization of hummingbirds in three habitat types (forest, shrubs, cattle ranch) sampled over 10 sessions across two years in the southern Andes of Ecuador. Specialization of hummingbird species in the networks was measured by three indices: d’ (related to niche partitioning), generality (related to niche width) and PSI (related to pollination services). Specialization indices d’, generality and PSI of hummingbird species were influenced by resource availability. All indices indicated that specialization of hummingbirds increased when the availability of resources decreased. Variation in d’ was also explained by an interaction between resource availability and bill length; hummingbirds with a long bill switched from being more specialized than other species when resource availability was low to being similarly specialized when availability was high. Overall, our results highlight the importance of ecological and evolutionary factors determining the specialization of species in interaction networks. We demonstrate in particular that ecological gradients in resource availability cause substantial changes in consumers’ foraging behavior contingent on their morphology. Changes in pollinator specialization along resource gradients can have impacts on ecosystem functions, such as pollination by animals.},

  abstract  = {Species invasions constitute a major and poorly understood threat to plant–pollinator systems. General theory predicting which factors drive species invasion success and subsequent effects on native ecosystems is particularly lacking. We address this problem using a consumer–resource model of adaptive behavior and population dynamics to evaluate the invasion success of alien pollinators into plant–pollinator networks and their impact on native species. We introduce pollinator species with different foraging traits into network models with different levels of species richness, connectance, and nestedness. Among 31 factors tested, including network and alien properties, we find that aliens with high foraging efficiency are the most successful invaders. Networks exhibiting high alien–native diet overlap, fraction of alien-visited plant species, most-generalist plant connectivity, and number of specialist pollinator species are the most impacted by invaders. Our results mimic several disparate observations conducted in the field and potentially elucidate the mechanisms responsible for their variability.},

Answering this question requires us to understand how pollinators analyze these signals with their visual and olfactory sense organs, and how the sensory systems work together with post-receptor neural wiring to produce a coherent percept of the world around them. Recent research on the dynamics with which bees store, manage and retrieve memories all have fundamental implications for how pollinators choose between flowers, and in turn for floral evolution. New findings regarding how attention, peak-shift phenomena, and speed–accuracy tradeoffs affect pollinator choice between flower species show that analyzing the evolutionary ecology of signal–receiver relationships can substantially benefit from knowledge about the neural mechanisms of visual and olfactory information processing.},

We tested whether this phenotypic specialization gradient is also found in the interaction patterns with their floral resources. Location Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania/Australia. Methods We compiled interaction networks between birds and floral resources for 79 hummingbird, nine sunbird and 33 honeyeater communities. Interaction specialization was quantified through connectance (C), complementary specialization (H2′), binary (QB) and weighted modularity (Q), with both observed and null-model corrected values. We compared interaction specialization among the three types of bird–flower communities, both independently and while controlling for potential confounding variables, such as plant species richness, asymmetry, latitude, insularity, topography, sampling methods and intensity. Results Hummingbird–flower networks were more specialized than honeyeater–flower networks. Specifically, hummingbird–flower networks had a lower proportion of realized interactions (lower C), decreased niche overlap (greater H2′) and greater modularity (greater QB). However, we found no significant differences between hummingbird– and sunbird–flower networks, nor between sunbird– and honeyeater–flower networks. Main conclusions As expected, hummingbirds and their floral resources have greater interaction specialization than honeyeaters, possibly because of greater phenotypic specialization and greater floral resource richness in the New World. Interaction specialization in sunbird–flower communities was similar to both hummingbird–flower and honeyeater–flower communities. This may either be due to the relatively small number of sunbird–flower networks available, or because sunbird–flower communities share features of both hummingbird–flower communities (specialized floral shapes) and honeyeater–flower communities (fewer floral resources). These results suggest a link between interaction specialization and both phenotypic specialization and floral resource richness within bird–flower communities at a global scale.},
