* include all quantitative host-parasitoid webs

* modularity (Ecology paper by Oleson?); visualise modularity in plotweb


* in second.extinct, use plot.it="higher"/"lower" to plot only one of the trophic levels (wish of Georg Anderson).

* use dirmult (in the same package) to fit Dirichlet-distribution to network data; use these to draw from random distributions in null models?

* check what package tnet does (it somewhere uses the term "weighted" and "two-mode")


* implement the hub-species-detection procedure of Gonzales et al. (Ecol Complex)

* replace current degree distribution fitting by Poisson-fitting (e.g. power.law.fit {igraph} via mle {stats4})



In the .Rbuildignore file the syntax is a bit strange:
\..* means (in Perl): starts with . (has to be escaped, hence \.) and is followed by characters ("."), and as many as you want ("*" is a wildcard).
So \..* refers to any file/directory starting with a ".".
To exclude specifically .hg, I guess it would be \..hg or so.
